				<h2>Facts about the Megalodon</h2>
				<div class="container">
					<p>The megalodon was the largest shark ever to have lived, believed to have reached 50 to 70 feet (15.2 to 21.3 meters) long.</p>
					<h3>Large teeth</h3>
					<p>The word megalodon comes from two Greek words â€” megas, meaning big, and odont, meaning tooth.</p>

					<h4>Big bite</h4>
					<p>The Megalodon has a big bite, it's bite is estimated to be 24,000 to 41,000 pounds of force. That is 10 times stronger than a great white shark. Its jaw is about 9 feet tall, and 11 feet wide. That is enough space to swallow and entire school bus and have room to keep going.</p>
